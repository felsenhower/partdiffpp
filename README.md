# partdiff++

This is a C++ port of partdiff, a program for calculation of partial
differential equations that was originally written in C.

partdiff++ is a bit faster than partdiff.
E.g., for 1 thread, GauÃŸ-Seidel, 1024 interlines, f(x,y) â‰  0, and 60 iterations (`./partdiff 1 1 1024 2 2 60`),
partdiff++ is consistently about 1.25 % faster than partdiff (over 10 runs). More benchmarks will follow. ðŸ™‚

The original partdiff was written by Prof. Dr. Thomas Ludwig and
Andreas C. Schmidt and is also available here:

The comments have been removed for now, but will return at some point.

Identifier names have not been changed where possible.

To my knowledge, the functionality is exactly the same:
As you can check with `make test`, the output is exactly the same as from the
original program for all tested inputs.

See https://github.com/mblesel/rust_partdiff for a Rust implementation. ðŸ™‚
